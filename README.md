  * Implement hourly staffing models and its best to ensure that all agents are available during the peak hour as identified at 11am - 1pm and 3pm to 5pm.

* Improve answered rate call
  * Suggest to include any unanswered call to the callback queue where any available agents can perform callback during non-busy hours.
    
* Improve CSAT
  * Improve agents’ performance by conducting monthly training sessions focused on enhancing communication skills, product knowledge, and system navigation (especially when a new system is implemented).
  * Followed up any case with low CSAT score to identify the root cause of the issue.
  * Ensure that agents consistently follow up with customers to provide updates on their queries, especially if the resolution requires additional time.
